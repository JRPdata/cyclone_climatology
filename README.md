# This is not an official work (so use at your own discretion):
#   Read the notes in the notebook first, as this requires multiple files from multiple sources to work properly!
#   That is, you must have the geonames databases from US,CA,MX for it to calculate landfall correctly
#   You also must have the best tracks from the correct source (See notebook)
# Note that PMFs/CDFs count storms that were present in the subperiods (not TC genesis)
